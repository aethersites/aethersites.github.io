   <p>
  This Privacy Policy explains how GoodPlates Ltd. ("GoodPlates", "we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, shares, and protects personal information when you visit or use our website, mobile applications and related services (collectively, the "Service"). It also explains your rights and choices regarding your personal data. Please read this policy carefully. By using the Service you consent to the processing described in this Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the Service.
</p>

<header><h2>1. Scope & Acceptance</h2></header>

<p>1.1  This Policy applies to personal data collected when you use the Service, register an account, purchase Paid Content, interact with creators, place third-party grocery orders via integrations, communicate with us, or otherwise interact with GoodPlates. Where payments are processed via Paddle (our Merchant of Record / "MoR"), Paddle processes certain buyer payment and invoicing data — see Sections 7 and 9 for details.</p>

<p>1.2  The Policy supplements any other agreements you have with GoodPlates (Terms & Conditions, Creator Agreements, Refund Policy) and describes practices across our web and mobile products unless a different policy is presented at the point of collection.</p>

<p>1.3  We may present shorter notices or consent banners at certain touchpoints (for cookies, billing, or third-party integrations). Those notices form part of the information we provide about data processing activities.</p>

<header><h2>2. Key Definitions</h2></header>

<p>2.1  <strong>"Personal data"</strong> — any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.</p>

<p>2.2  <strong>"Processing"</strong> — any operation performed on personal data (collection, storage, use, disclosure, deletion, etc.).</p>

<p>2.3  <strong>"Controller"</strong> — GoodPlates determines the purposes and means of processing most personal data collected via the Service. For payments and invoicing processed by Paddle, Paddle is the Merchant of Record and a separate controller for those activities; in some cases we and Paddle may act as joint controllers for specific processing purposes (see Section 7).</p>

<p>2.4  <strong>"Processor"</strong> — third-party service providers who process data on our behalf under contract (e.g., payment processors, analytics providers, cloud hosts).</p>

<header><h2>3. Information We Collect</h2></header>

<p>We collect information you provide and information collected automatically.</p>

<p>3.1  <strong>Information you provide directly:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Account information: email, name, display name, password (hashed), profile photo, phone number.</li>
  <li>Profile and preferences: dietary preferences, allergies, nutrition goals, dietary type, preferred units, default currency, household size, preferred delivery options.</li>
  <li>Content you create or upload: grocery lists, recipes, pantry items, custom ingredients, notes, saved recipes, course materials, ratings, comments and messages.</li>
  <li>Payment & billing info: When you subscribe or buy Paid Content via Paddle (our MoR) or other authorised payment providers, Paddle or the payment provider will process card/payment details. GoodPlates does not store full card numbers; we may store billing addresses, masked payment metadata (e.g., last 4 digits) and transaction identifiers required for fulfilment and support.</li>
  <li>Communications: customer support messages, survey answers and feedback.</li>
</ul>

<p>3.2  <strong>Information collected automatically:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Usage and telemetry: pages visited, features used, timestamps, session duration, clickstreams, and performance metrics.</li>
  <li>Device & technical data: device type, operating system, browser, screen resolution, IP address (may imply approximate location), device identifiers, app version.</li>
  <li>Diagnostics & crash logs: application errors and logs that help us debug and improve the Service.</li>
</ul>

<p>3.3  <strong>Derived and inferred data:</strong></p>
<p>Inferences we create from other data such as dietary preferences inferred from activity, suggested grocery items, interest segments used for personalization and ads.</p>

<p>3.4  <strong>Information from third parties:</strong></p>
<p>Social login data (if you sign in with Google/Apple/etc.), grocery partner order updates, analytics partners, marketing partners, and publicly available sources. If you link third-party grocery services or accounts, we may receive order and profile details from those partners subject to your consent.</p>

<header><h2>4. How We Use Your Information</h2></header>

<p>We use personal data for these purposes:</p>

<p>4.1  <strong>Provide and operate the Service:</strong> Authenticate users, manage accounts, store and present recipes, generate grocery lists, manage pantries, process orders via integrated partners, and to enable paid subscriptions and purchases.</p>

<p>4.2  <strong>Personalization:</strong> Tailor recipe suggestions, meal plans, grocery recommendations and UI elements based on your preferences, pantry contents and past behavior.</p>

<p>4.3  <strong>Payments & billing:</strong> Process subscriptions and purchases, manage invoices and refunds, reconcile transactions and communicate billing-related information. For purchases processed via Paddle, Paddle issues invoices, handles tax collection and remittance, and manages refunds and chargebacks — GoodPlates provides the minimum information required to enable these functions.</p>

<p>4.4  <strong>Communications:</strong> Send transactional messages (account notices, order confirmations), marketing communications (with consent where required), system alerts and customer support responses.</p>

<p>4.5  <strong>Analytics & product improvement:</strong> Aggregate usage data to improve features, fix bugs, and study how users engage with the Service.</p>

<p>4.6  <strong>Fraud detection & security:</strong> Monitor and prevent unauthorized access, abuse and fraudulent activity. We and Paddle may exchange risk indicators and transaction metadata to detect and prevent fraud; this may include KYC/AML-related checks where required.</p>

<p>4.7  <strong>Legal compliance & risk management:</strong> Comply with legal obligations, enforce our agreements, defend claims and protect our legal rights. This includes tax and accounting obligations and responding to lawful requests from authorities.</p>

<p>4.8  <strong>Marketing & advertising:</strong> With consent where required, use data for targeted advertising, measuring campaign effectiveness and building audience segments. See Cookies & Advertising.</p>

<header><h2>5. Legal Bases for Processing (EEA/UK users)</h2></header>

<p>5.1  <strong>Performance of a contract:</strong> To provide the Service and fulfill orders and subscriptions.</p>

<p>5.2  <strong>Consent:</strong> Where required (cookies for non-essential tracking, targeted advertising). You may withdraw consent at any time.</p>

<p>5.3  <strong>Legal obligation:</strong> To comply with laws, tax reporting, KYC/AML checks, or law enforcement requests.</p>

<p>5.4  <strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> For fraud prevention, analytics, product improvement, internal operations and security — provided those interests are balanced against your rights (we will not rely on legitimate interests where your rights override that basis).</p>

<header><h2>6. Cookies & Tracking Technologies</h2></header>

<p>6.1  <strong>Cookies & similar tech.</strong> We use cookies, local storage, pixel tags, and similar technologies to provide the Service, remember settings, analyze traffic and serve ads. Cookies are categorized as:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Essential</em> — required for login, security, and core functionality.</li>
  <li><em>Performance & analytics</em> — to measure and improve the Service.</li>
  <li><em>Functional</em> — remember preferences and UI choices.</li>
  <li><em>Advertising/targeting</em> — to deliver relevant ads and measure ad campaigns.</li>
</ul>

<p>6.2  <strong>Consent & controls.</strong> Where required by law we will show a cookie banner and obtain consent for non-essential cookies. You can manage cookie preferences through the cookie banner, your browser settings, or the account privacy settings. Note that disabling some cookies may reduce functionality.</p>

<p>6.3  <strong>Third-party cookies.</strong> Our partners (analytics and ad networks, Paddle where applicable for payment UX) may set cookies. These providers have their own privacy practices. We recommend reviewing their policies and available opt-out tools.</p>

<header><h2>7. Sharing & Disclosure (including Paddle & Payment Partners)</h2></header>

<p>We do not sell your personal data. We may share data as follows:</p>

<p>7.1  <strong>Service providers & processors.</strong> With vendors who perform services for us (cloud hosting, payment processors, analytics providers, email delivery, customer support platforms). We contractually restrict their use of data to performing services for GoodPlates and require appropriate safeguards (DPAs, SCCs where applicable).</p>

<p>7.2  <strong>Paddle (Merchant of Record) and payment partners.</strong> For purchases processed via Paddle, we share the minimum necessary contact, transaction and billing metadata with Paddle so Paddle can issue invoices, collect and remit taxes, process refunds, and manage chargebacks. Paddle is the Merchant of Record for those transactions and maintains its own privacy practices and legal obligations. Where we and Paddle determine purposes and means jointly for specific processing, we will identify the joint-controller responsibilities and provide information on how to exercise rights (see Section 11). Consult Paddle’s Privacy Policy and Data Sharing Addendum for details of their processing.</p>

<p>7.3  <strong>Grocery partners & integration providers.</strong> When you choose to connect or place orders via third-party grocery platforms, we share the minimum required order, delivery and payment token data to complete the transaction and to enable fulfilment and customer service.</p>

<p>7.4  <strong>Business transfers.</strong> In connection with mergers, acquisitions, reorganizations or asset sales we may transfer user data as part of the transaction subject to confidentiality obligations. We will notify users where required by law.</p>

<p>7.5  <strong>Legal requirements.</strong> When required by law, legal process, governmental request or to protect rights, property, or safety. We will comply with valid court orders and lawful requests.</p>

<p>7.6  <strong>Aggregate & anonymized data.</strong> We may share aggregated, anonymized datasets that do not identify individuals for research, benchmarking and business purposes.</p>

<header><h2>8. Third-Party Services & Links</h2></header>

<p>8.1  The Service may contain links to third-party websites, integrations, social logins or partner apps. These third parties have separate privacy practices; GoodPlates is not responsible for their activities. Review third-party privacy policies before sharing data with them.</p>

<p>8.2  When integrating accounts (e.g., Google, Apple) we will request your permission and will only access data that you authorize.</p>

<header><h2>9. International Transfers & Safeguards</h2></header>

<p>9.1  Because we operate internationally, your personal data may be transferred to countries with different data protection laws (including outside the EEA). When transferring data we rely on appropriate safeguards such as: adequacy decisions, Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), or other lawful mechanisms. Paddle and other processors may transfer data under their own safeguards; consult their documentation for details.</p>

<p>9.2  By using the Service you consent to such transfers where necessary for the Service to operate.</p>

<header><h2>10. Data Retention</h2></header>

<p>10.1  We retain personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes stated (to provide the Service, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce agreements, and for legitimate business purposes).</p>

<p>10.2  Example retention periods (subject to change and applicable laws):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Account data and profile: retained while account is active and for up to 2 years after deletion for backup and legal compliance.</li>
  <li>Transaction and billing records: retained for 6–10 years for tax and accounting compliance depending on jurisdiction. For purchases processed by Paddle, Paddle retains invoice/payment records as required by law; GoodPlates retains relevant transaction metadata for reconciliation and support.</li>
  <li>Analytics and usage logs: often retained for 12–36 months in aggregated or pseudonymized form.</li>
  <li>Support communications: retained for as long as reasonably necessary to provide support and for record-keeping.</li>
</ul>

<p>10.3  After retention requirements expire we will delete or irreversibly anonymize personal data.</p>

<header><h2>11. Your Rights & Choices</h2></header>

<p>11.1  <strong>Access & portability.</strong> You may request access to personal data we hold about you, and request a machine-readable copy in common formats.</p>

<p>11.2  <strong>Rectification.</strong> You may correct inaccurate or incomplete data via account settings or by contacting us.</p>

<p>11.3  <strong>Erasure</strong> (right to be forgotten): You may request deletion of your account and personal data. We will comply subject to legal obligations (e.g., tax, accounting), our legitimate interests (fraud prevention), and safety considerations.</p>

<p>11.4  <strong>Restriction & objection.</strong> You may request restriction of processing or object to processing where we rely on legitimate interests (including profiling). We will assess and respond consistent with applicable law.</p>

<p>11.5  <strong>Withdraw consent.</strong> Where processing is based on consent (e.g., targeted advertising), you may withdraw consent at any time. Withdrawal does not affect processing that occurred prior to withdrawal.</p>

<p>11.6  <strong>Right to complain.</strong> If you are in the EEA/UK you have the right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority (e.g., the Dutch Data Protection Authority) in addition to contacting us.</p>

<p>11.7  <strong>How to exercise rights.</strong> To exercise rights contact: dpo@goodplates.com or use in-app privacy controls. For data related to payments/invoices processed by Paddle, please consult Paddle’s privacy documentation and exercise rights with Paddle where appropriate — we will cooperate with Paddle to respond to joint-controller requests in accordance with applicable law. We will verify identity before responding to certain requests and will respond within applicable statutory timeframes.</p>

<header><h2>12. Automated Decision-Making & Profiling</h2></header>

<p>12.1  We use automated systems (including machine learning) to generate recommendations, personalize content, and build audience segments for advertising.</p>

<p>12.2  These automated systems are intended to assist and optimize the Service. They do not make final legal, medical or financial decisions. Where automated decisions could have legal or similarly significant effects we will provide meaningful information and, where required by law, allow request for human review or opt-out.</p>

<header><h2>13. Security</h2></header>

<p>13.1  We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to safeguard personal data, including encryption in transit (TLS), access controls, secure hosting, regular security assessments and employee training.</p>

<p>13.2  Despite these measures, no security system is impenetrable. If we detect a data breach that is likely to result in a high risk to individuals’ rights and freedoms, we will notify affected users and relevant supervisory authorities in accordance with applicable law. For incidents involving payment data processed by Paddle, Paddle may issue separate notifications consistent with its obligations.</p>

<p>13.3  You can help protect your account by choosing a strong password, enabling platform MFA where offered, and keeping your credentials secure.</p>

<header><h2>14. Children</h2></header>

<p>14.1  The Service is not intended for children below the applicable minimum age in your jurisdiction (16 in the EEA by default). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children without parental consent. If we learn we have collected such data we will delete it promptly.</p>

<header><h2>15. Marketing & Communications</h2></header>

<p>15.1  We send transactional messages related to your account and purchases regardless of marketing preferences. Promotional emails require opt-in where required by law and include unsubscribe options.</p>

<p>15.2  For targeted advertising we work with ad platforms and audience partners. You can opt out of interest-based ads via our cookie settings or via industry opt-out tools (e.g., the DAA consumer choice, Google ad settings). If you are a California resident, see Section 21.2 for CCPA/CPRA-related options.</p>

<header><h2>16. Third-Party Processors (examples)</h2></header>

<p>16.1  Examples of processor categories (subject to change): cloud hosting providers, payment processors (Paddle and others), email delivery, analytics (Google Analytics, Amplitude), customer support tools (Zendesk/Intercom), ad networks.</p>

<p>16.2  We require processors to process data only on our instructions and to maintain appropriate safeguards (Data Processing Agreements). Processor lists may be available on request.</p>

<header><h2>17. International Users</h2></header>

<p>17.1  If you access the Service from outside the Netherlands, your data may be transferred to and processed in other countries. By using the Service you consent to these transfers under the safeguards described (SCCs, adequacy decisions) or other lawful mechanisms.</p>

<header><h2>18. Data Breach & Incident Response</h2></header>

<p>18.1  We maintain an incident response process. If a breach occurs, we will investigate, contain and remediate the incident and notify affected users and authorities as required by law, providing meaningful information about risks and mitigation steps. For incidents involving payment data processed by Paddle, Paddle may issue separate notifications consistent with its obligations.</p>

<header><h2>19. Changes to this Policy</h2></header>

<p>19.1  We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our practices or legal requirements. When changes are material we will provide notice (in-app, email or prominent site notice) before changes take effect. The "Last Updated" date at the top indicates when the Policy was last revised.</p>

<p>19.2  Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Policy.</p>
