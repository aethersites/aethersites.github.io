      </header>

      <section class="content" aria-label="Terms content">
        <div class="placeholder">
<br> These Terms & Conditions (the "Terms") are a binding agreement between you ("you", "your", or "User") and GoodPlates Ltd. ("GoodPlates", "we", "us", or "our") governing your access to and use of GoodPlates' website, mobile applications and related services (collectively, the Service). The Service includes our meal planning tools, grocery integrations, health & nutrition tracking, pantry management, analytics, family & collaboration features, educational course packs, creator and community features, and other features described on the Service.<br><br>

By accessing or using the Service you agree to these Terms and to our Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, and any other documents we incorporate by reference. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.<br><br>

<header><h2>1. Definitions</h2></header>
1.1 **User Content:** Content you submit, post, upload or otherwise make available through the Service (recipes, photos, course materials, ratings, comments, profile information, etc.).<br>
<br>1.2 **Creator Content:** User Content uploaded by users who make content available to others (free or paid).<br>
<br>1.3 **Third-Party Services:** Services operated by third parties (grocery delivery platforms, payment processors, ad networks, analytics providers, social login providers, etc.) that may be linked to or integrated with the Service. Where payments are processed through Paddle (see Section 9), Paddle acts as the Merchant of Record for those transactions.<br>
<br>1.4 **Paid Content:** Any content or features offered for a fee (subscriptions, course packs, in-app purchases, creator-paid content).<br>
<br>1.5 **Processing / Process / Processed:** Any operation performed on personal data, as defined under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).<br><br>

<header><h2>2. Eligibility & Account Registration</h2></header>
2.1 You must be at least 16 years old to create an account for our Service in the EEA unless local law requires a higher age. If you are below the applicable age you may use the Service only with parental or guardian consent.<br>
<br>2.2 You are responsible for maintaining confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activity under your account. Notify us immediately of any unauthorized use. We may suspend accounts where fraud or misuse is suspected.<br>
<br>2.3 You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information when registering and to update it as necessary. For accounts or transactions where Paddle requires KYC/AML information, you must provide accurate details to Paddle if requested as part of onboarding or compliance processes.<br><br>

<header><h2>3. Core Service Features (overview)</h2></header>
3.1 The Service includes (but is not limited to) the features described in our product documentation and Privacy Policy. GoodPlates remains the creator/licensor of the products and content we provide; where you purchase Paid Content through the Service, the licensing terms are set out in the applicable EULA or license documentation.<br>
<br>3.2 For purchases processed via Paddle (our Merchant of Record partner), Paddle handles checkout, invoicing, tax collection and certain buyer-facing payments communications. GoodPlates handles product delivery, licensing, support, and fulfilment as described in the product pages and EULA.<br><br>

<header><h2>4. User Conduct & Prohibited Activities</h2></header>
4.1 You agree not to:<br>
- Post illegal, infringing, defamatory, obscene, abusive, hateful, harassing, pornographic, or violent content.<br>
- Upload malware or exploit the Service to distribute malicious code.<br>
- Misrepresent your identity or credentials.<br>
- Infringe others' intellectual property, privacy or publicity rights.<br>
- Manipulate or falsify ratings, reviews, or usage metrics.<br>
- Use the Service to place unlawful orders or commit fraud.<br>
- Attempt to circumvent or manipulate Paddle's checkout, invoicing, refund or chargeback mechanisms (including using multiple accounts or shell entities to avoid risk controls).<br>
<br>4.2 We may suspend or terminate accounts for violations, suspected fraud, or abusive behavior in our discretion. Paddle may also suspend payments or transactions where it detects risk or non-compliance; such actions are separate from GoodPlates' account actions and may affect your ability to receive refunds or payouts.<br><br>

<header><h2>5. User Content & Licensing</h2></header>
5.1 By posting User Content you grant GoodPlates a worldwide, non-exclusive, transferable, sublicensable, royalty-free license to store, use, reproduce, modify, publish, distribute, publicly display and perform, and create derivative works of that content for the purpose of operating, promoting, improving, and developing the Service (including making content available to other users and in marketing).<br>
<br>5.2 Creator Content intended for distribution or sale remains owned by the creator, but the creator grants GoodPlates the same rights above (plus rights necessary to market, distribute and operate the content). Specific revenue share and creator compensation will be governed by separate Creator Agreements. Creators selling content through the Service acknowledge that payments may be processed by Paddle as Merchant of Record and that Paddle may withhold or set off funds in accordance with its Master Services Agreement for chargebacks, refunds, fines or fraudulent activity.<br>
<br>5.3 You represent and warrant that you have all rights to post the content and that posting does not violate any law or third-party rights. You will indemnify GoodPlates and Paddle for claims arising from your content as set out in Section 18.<br><br>

<header><h2>6. Moderation, Removal & DMCA</h2></header>
6.1 We may review, moderate, remove or refuse to post any User Content that violates these Terms or applicable law. We are not obligated to monitor all content but may do so. Where content is removed, we may notify Paddle if the content relates to a transaction or Marketplace listing.<br>
<br>6.2 If you believe content infringes your copyright, follow the takedown process in our Copyright Policy (DMCA for U.S. claims) and provide required information. If an infringement claim affects a paid offering, Paddle may be notified and may take action in its capacity as Merchant of Record (including refunds or removals) while we investigate.<br><br>

<header><h2>7. AI Features, Health & Nutrition Disclaimers</h2></header>
7.1 AI-generated recipe suggestions, pantry inferences, and nutritional estimates are informational and may be imperfect. They are based on available data (ingredient databases, user inputs, public sources) and can vary by brand, portioning and preparation.<br>
<br>7.2 The Service does not provide medical, clinical, or personalized dietary advice. Always consult a qualified healthcare professional or registered dietitian for medical or nutritional guidance. GoodPlates is not liable for adverse effects from diet or recipes.<br>
<br>7.3 If you rely on AI features you accept the models may produce unexpected or biased outputs; we do not warrant accuracy. Where profiling or automated decision-making is used (including for advertising), you have the rights described in Section 11.7.<br><br>

<header><h2>8. Grocery Integration & Third-Party Orders</h2></header>
8.1 When you place orders through integrated third-party grocery services, those orders are placed with the third party and are governed by their terms. GoodPlates is not the vendor for those products.<br>
<br>8.2 You authorize GoodPlates to share relevant order, list, delivery address and payment token data with the third-party provider you select. We are not responsible for price changes, substitutions, delivery issues or order fulfillment by third-party providers. Contact the third party for order support.<br>
<br>8.3 In-app grocery lists are tools to help you shop—they do not guarantee item availability.<br><br>

<header><h2>9. Payments, Subscriptions & Refunds</h2></header>
9.1 **Paddle as Merchant of Record.** For purchases where Paddle is used at checkout, Paddle (or an affiliated Paddle entity) is the Merchant of Record ("MoR"). Paddle will process payment, issue electronic invoices/receipts, collect and remit applicable sales taxes/VAT/GST, and handle chargebacks and refunds in accordance with Paddle's policies. For payment questions, invoices, tax queries, and refund status for Paddle-processed transactions, contact Paddle directly (see Paddle communications on your receipt). For product, licensing, delivery or support questions, contact GoodPlates as described in Section 8.<br>
<br>9.2 **No direct payments.** Do not accept or request direct payment from buyers for transactions processed by Paddle. If a buyer pays you directly outside of Paddle for a Paddle-processed product, that payment will not be covered by Paddle's invoicing and consumer protections and may be refundable only at your discretion.<br>
<br>9.3 **Subscription terms & cancellation.** Subscription terms (billing interval, renewal, trial period) are shown at checkout. Subscriptions auto-renew unless cancelled. Buyers may cancel recurring subscriptions via the cancellation link in Paddle emails, via their Paddle account, or as directed at checkout. To avoid renewal charges, cancel at least 48 hours before the next billing date unless the product page or local law specifies otherwise.<br>
<br>9.4 **Refunds & consumer rights.** Paddle administers refunds and chargebacks in line with its policies and applicable law. Consumers may have a statutory cancellation period (for example, a 14-day right to cancel for certain remote purchases) unless that right is lawfully waived for immediate digital delivery with explicit consent at the time of purchase. Paddle may refuse refunds in cases of fraud, abuse, or manipulation. Where GoodPlates agrees to a refund, we will notify Paddle and follow their procedures—do not process refunds outside Paddle for Paddle-processed transactions.<br>
<br>9.5 **Fees, set-off & withholding.** Paddle charges a platform discount/fee and may apply currency conversion margins; these appear on your Paddle supplier dashboard. Paddle may set off refunds, chargebacks, fines, and fraud losses against future payouts to GoodPlates or retain funds and withhold payouts where required by law or where risk is detected. Paddle's Master Services Agreement permits retention of funds for a period (commonly up to six months) to cover potential chargebacks or subscription obligations post-termination.<br>
<br>9.6 **Wire transfers & non-covered payment methods.** Some payment methods (e.g., wire transfers) may not be covered by certain consumer credit protections and carry increased refund risk; Paddle will indicate coverage per payment method at checkout.<br><br>

<header><h2>10. Pricing Errors</h2></header>
10.1 We aim for accurate pricing but reserve the right to cancel or correct obvious errors. Where a purchase has been made through Paddle and an error is discovered, Paddle may cancel the transaction or issue a refund in accordance with its policies and with notice to the buyer and GoodPlates.<br><br>

<header><h2>11. Privacy, GDPR & Data Use (including advertising)</h2></header>
11.1 **Overview & coordination with Paddle.** Our Privacy Policy explains what personal data we collect, how we use it, how we share it, and your rights. Where Paddle processes payment or invoicing data for a transaction, Paddle is a separate controller/processor for those processing activities. We and Paddle may be joint controllers for certain processing; see our Privacy Policy and Paddle's Privacy Policy and Data Sharing Addendum for details.<br>
<br>11.2 **Lawful bases for processing (GDPR).** For EEA/UK users, lawful bases include contract performance (to provide purchases and subscriptions), legal obligation (tax and accounting), legitimate interests (fraud prevention, product improvement) and consent (where applicable, e.g., marketing cookies).<br>
<br>11.3 **Data sharing with Paddle & processors.** By purchasing you consent to sharing contact, transactional and limited payment metadata with Paddle and its processors to complete the transaction, issue invoices, remit taxes and perform fraud prevention. We only share the data necessary for these purposes and require processors to meet security and legal standards (e.g., SCCs where applicable).<br>
<br>11.4 **International transfers & safeguards.** Data may be transferred outside the EEA/UK to Paddle or other service providers; we use adequate safeguards such as adequacy decisions, Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), or other lawful mechanisms to protect data transfers.<br>
<br>11.5 **Your rights & exercising them.** You have rights to access, rectify, delete, restrict, port data, and object to processing where permitted by law. For data related to payments/invoices processed by Paddle, please consult Paddle's privacy documentation and exercise rights with Paddle where appropriate; for product and account data managed by GoodPlates, contact dpo@goodplates.com or use in-app controls. We will cooperate with Paddle to respond to joint controller requests in accordance with applicable law.<br>
<br>11.6 **Cookies & tracking.** We and our advertising partners use cookies and tracking for functionality, analytics and advertising; consent may be required for targeted advertising. Manage preferences via our cookie banner and account settings.<br><br>

<header><h2>12. Advertising, Promotions & Communications</h2></header>
12.1 Promotional messages, newsletters or marketing communications require your consent where required by law; you may opt out at any time via email links or account settings. Transactional messages required to manage orders, invoicing or refunds for Paddle transactions may be sent by Paddle without marketing consent as part of payment processing.<br>
<br>12.2 We may allow creators and third parties to advertise on the Service; those third parties’ ads are subject to their own terms and privacy practices. GoodPlates and Paddle are not responsible for third-party promotional content outside the scope of our agreements.<br><br>

<header><h2>13. Intellectual Property</h2></header>
13.1 GoodPlates and its licensors own all rights in the Service, including software, trademarks, trade dress, photographic and written materials. You receive only a limited, revocable, non-exclusive license to use the Service in accordance with these Terms.<br>
<br>13.2 You may not copy, modify, distribute, reverse engineer, or create derivative works of the Service without our express written permission. Creators who license or sell content through the Service represent that they own the IP or have the appropriate licenses; creators agree to indemnify GoodPlates and Paddle for IP claims arising from their content as set out in Section 18.<br><br>

<header><h2>14. Security & Data Breach Notification</h2></header>
14.1 We use commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect personal data. No system is completely secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security. You must keep your account credentials safe.<br>
<br>14.2 If a personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to individuals' rights and freedoms, we will notify affected users and the relevant supervisory authority in accordance with GDPR timelines. For incidents impacting payment data processed by Paddle, Paddle may issue separate notifications consistent with its obligations and procedures.<br><br>

<header><h2>15. Analytics & Aggregated Data</h2></header>
15.1 We may analyze user activity and create aggregated, anonymized datasets for product improvement, research and marketing. Aggregated/anonymized data may be used for advertising, business analytics, benchmarking and to enhance the Service without identifying individuals. Aggregated data derived from Paddle-provided transaction metadata may be used in accordance with Paddle’s data sharing rules.<br><br>

<header><h2>16. Warranties, Disclaimers & Food Safety</h2></header>
16.1 THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE." GOODPLATES DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.<br>
<br>16.2 Nutritional calculations, AI suggestions, and recipe instructions are estimates and guides only. They are not a substitute for professional advice. Users with allergies or medical conditions must verify ingredients and consult professionals as needed. GoodPlates is not responsible for adverse outcomes from food prepared using the Service.<br>
<br>16.3 **Supplier warranty for paid products.** For Paid Content we warrant that we are authorized to license the product and that the product materially conforms to its description at the time of sale. Remedies for defective or non-conforming products are subject to the purchase terms and Paddle's refund/chargeback procedures where Paddle is MoR.<br><br>

<header><h2>17. Limitation of Liability</h2></header>
17.1 TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, GOODPLATES (AND ITS AFFILIATES, EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, LICENSORS AND PARTNERS) WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, DATA LOSS, OR LOSS OF BUSINESS, ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE.<br>
<br>17.2 WHERE APPLICABLE LAW DOES NOT ALLOW LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, OUR LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED. If you have paid for a Service, our aggregate liability for direct damages will not exceed the amount you paid to GoodPlates in the 6 months prior to the claim (or €100 if you have not paid us). For payment processing, Paddle's liability and limitation provisions may also apply to buyers and suppliers and are governed by Paddle's agreements.<br><br>

<header><h2>18. Indemnification</h2></header>
18.1 You agree to indemnify and hold GoodPlates, Paddle and their affiliates harmless against claims, liabilities, losses and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from your breach of these Terms, your User Content, your use of the Service, or your violation of law. Creators and suppliers indemnify GoodPlates and Paddle for claims arising from product defects, IP infringement, regulatory non-compliance, or inaccurate product descriptions.<br><br>

<header><h2>19. Termination & Account Deletion</h2></header>
19.1 We may suspend or terminate your access for breach, suspected fraud, inactivity, or other reasons. On termination you must stop using the Service. Certain obligations survive termination (including Sections 5, 11, 13, 16, 17, 18 and 22).<br>
<br>19.2 **Paddle suspension/termination effects.** Paddle may suspend or terminate payment services or withhold funds where fraud, excessive chargebacks, or legal non-compliance is suspected. Such actions by Paddle may affect buyers' access to refunds and suppliers' payouts; we will cooperate with Paddle to the extent permitted by contract and law. Paddle may retain funds for a period (often up to six months) to cover chargebacks/ongoing subscription obligations in line with its Master Services Agreement.<br>
<br>19.3 You can request account deletion via account settings or by contacting support. Deletion does not necessarily remove copies stored in backups or as required by law.<br><br>

<header><h2>20. Changes to the Service & These Terms</h2></header>
20.1 We may modify the Service or these Terms. If we materially change these Terms we will provide notice (in-app, by email, or other reasonable means). Continued use after notification constitutes acceptance of changes. Review Terms periodically.<br>
<br>20.2 Paddle may amend its payment/invoicing terms with notice to suppliers or buyers; such changes affect the payment processing aspects of your purchase and will be governed by Paddle's published terms and the applicable Master Services Agreement between Paddle and GoodPlates.<br><br>

<header><h2>21. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h2></header>
21.1 These Terms are governed by the laws of the Netherlands, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules (chosen because GoodPlates is headquartered in Amsterdam).<br>
<br>21.2 **Paddle-specific law allocation.** Notwithstanding the above, Paddle's activities as Merchant of Record (payment processing, invoicing, tax collection, refunds) are governed by the Paddle agreements that apply to those activities. Paddle's Master Services Agreement is generally governed by English law (with certain exceptions for U.S. consumer transactions, which may be governed by New York law). For questions about payment law or invoices, consult Paddle's terms and notices on your receipt.<br>
<br>21.3 For disputes concerning our Service, please contact us first at support@goodplates.com. If unresolved, disputes shall be submitted to the courts of Amsterdam, the Netherlands, subject to mandatory consumer law exceptions and any jurisdictional rules applicable to Paddle for payment disputes.<br><br>

<header><h2>22. Export Controls, Sanctions & Compliance</h2></header>
22.1 You agree not to use the Service in violation of export controls or economic sanctions and to comply with applicable laws. We and Paddle will comply with applicable export and sanctions restrictions; we may block transactions, suspend accounts, or refuse service where required by law or payment scheme rules.<br><br>

<header><h2>23. Beta Features & Changes to Algorithms</h2></header>
23.1 Beta or experimental features (AI models, recommendation engines) may change or be removed and may be subject to additional terms. Use at your own risk. We may modify algorithms for safety, compliance, or commercial reasons and will provide notices where appropriate.<br><br>

<header><h2>24. Miscellaneous</h2></header>
24.1 Entire agreement: These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, Refund Policy and any other documents referenced, constitute the full agreement.<br>
<br>24.2 No waiver: Failure to exercise a right is not a waiver.<br>
<br>24.3 Assignment: You may not assign these Terms without our consent; GoodPlates may assign without restriction. Note that Paddle may assign or subcontract payment processing functions under its agreements.<br>
<br>24.4 Severability: If a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect.<br><br>
