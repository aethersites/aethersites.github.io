<header><h2>7. AI Features, Health & Nutrition Disclaimers</h2></header>
7.1 AI-generated recipe suggestions, pantry inferences, and nutritional estimates are informational, provided for convenience, and may be imperfect. They are based on available data (ingredient databases, user inputs, public sources) and can vary by brand, portioning and preparation.<br>
<br>7.2 The Service does not provide medical, clinical, or personalized dietary advice. Always consult a qualified healthcare professional or registered dietitian for medical or nutritional guidance. GoodPlates is not liable for adverse effects from diet or recipes.<br>
<br>7.3 If you rely on AI features you accept the models may produce unexpected or biased outputs; we do not warrant accuracy.<br><br>

<header><h2>8. Grocery Integration & Third-Party Orders</h2></header>
8.1 When you place orders through integrated third-party grocery services, those orders are placed with the third party and are governed by their terms. GoodPlates is not the vendor for those products.<br>
<br>8.2 You authorize GoodPlates to share relevant order, list, delivery address and payment token data with the third-party provider you select. We are not responsible for price changes, substitutions, delivery issues or order fulfillment by third-party providers. Contact the third party for order support.<br>
<br>8.3 In-app grocery lists are tools to help you shopâ€”they do not guarantee item availability.<br><br>

<header><h2>9. Payments, Subscriptions & Refunds</h2></header>
9.1 Paid Content (subscriptions, course packs, in-app purchases) is processed via third-party payment processors. By paying you agree to be charged and to the payment processor's terms.<br>
<br>9.2 Subscriptions auto-renew unless cancelled prior to renewal; cancellation must be done via account settings or the app store used to purchase. Refunds will follow our Refund Policy; except as required by law, paid purchases are generally non-refundable.<br>
<br>9.3 Taxes and duties are the buyer's responsibility.<br><br>

<header><h2>10. Pricing Errors</h2></header>
10.1 We aim for accurate pricing but reserve the right to cancel or correct obvious errors. We will notify you if we cancel an order for a pricing error.<br><br>

<header><h2>11. Privacy, GDPR & Data Use (including advertising)</h2></header>
11.1 Overview & Documents. Our Privacy Policy (link) explains what personal data we collect, how we use it, how we share it, and your rights. These Terms supplement that policy.<br>
<br>11.2 Lawful bases for processing. For users in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the UK, GoodPlates processes personal data on one or more lawful bases under the GDPR: (a) consent (for cookies, targeted advertising and certain profiling activities); (b) performance of a contract (to provide the Service and fulfill orders); (c) legal obligation (to comply with laws, tax, and record keeping); and (d) legitimate interests (for fraud prevention, analytics, improving products, and certain communications), subject to balancing tests. We identify the applicable lawful basis where required in our Privacy Policy.<br>
<br>11.3 Use of data for advertising, personalization & profiling.<br>
- We and our partners may use personal data (including usage, device identifiers, cookie IDs, location, demographic and inferred interests) to deliver personalized marketing and advertising, to measure ad effectiveness, and to build audience segments. Personalized ads and profiling are provided either on the basis of your consent or, where lawful and disclosed, our legitimate interests after a balancing assessment.<br>
- Where we rely on consent for targeted advertising, we will request clear consent (for example via cookie banner / settings) and provide an easy way to withdraw consent at any time. Where legitimate interests apply, you may exercise the right to object as described below.<br>
- We may combine information collected on GoodPlates with information from third-party partners (ad networks, social platforms, analytics providers) to serve relevant ads. These partners may set their own cookies and use other tracking technologies; see our Cookie Policy and Privacy Policy for details.<br>
<br>11.4 Cookies & tracking controls. We use cookies and similar technologies for functional needs, analytics, and advertising. You can manage cookie preferences through the cookie banner/settings and within account privacy settings. Opt-outs for cross-site advertising may also be available via industry opt-out mechanisms.<br>
<br>11.5 Sharing & third-party processors. We share personal data with third-party processors (payment processors, grocery partners, cloud providers, analytics and ad networks). We use contracts (data processing agreements) and where required Standard Contractual Clauses, adequacy decisions, or other safeguards for transfers outside the EEA/UK.<br>
<br>11.6 Data subject rights under the GDPR. If you are in the EEA/UK you have rights including:<br>
- Right of access (confirm whether we process your data and obtain a copy);<br>
- Right to rectification (correct inaccurate personal data);<br>
- Right to erasure (right to be forgotten) subject to legal exceptions;<br>
- Right to restriction of processing;<br>
- Right to data portability (receive your personal data in a common machine-readable format);<br>
- Right to object to processing for direct marketing or profiling;<br>
- Right to withdraw consent (where processing is based on consent) without affecting processing lawfully done before withdrawal; and<br>
- Right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority.<br>
To exercise these rights contact: dpo@goodplates.com (or use the in-app privacy controls). We will respond in accordance with GDPR timeframes. Proof of identity may be required.<br>
<br>11.7 Automated decision-making & profiling. Where automated profiling or automated decision-making (including AI-driven recommendations or ad targeting) produces decisions with legal or similarly significant effects, you have the right to obtain human intervention, express your point of view, and challenge the decision. Our AI features are primarily used to suggest recipes, plan meals, and present recommendations; they do not make final legal, medical or financial decisions. For profiling used in advertising we will provide meaningful information about the logic involved and opt-out mechanisms where required by law.<br>
<br>11.8 Data retention. We retain personal data as long as necessary to provide the Service, meet contractual and legal obligations (for example tax or accounting rules), and for the periods described in our Privacy Policy. After account deletion we may retain anonymized or aggregated data for analytics and platform improvement.<br>
<br>11.9 Childrenâ€™s data. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal data from children below applicable minimum ages (16 in EEA by default) without parental consent. If we learn we have collected such data we will delete it in accordance with applicable law.<br><br>

<header><h2>12. Advertising, Promotions & Communications</h2></header>
12.1 Promotional messages, newsletters or marketing communications require your consent where required by law; you may opt out at any time via email links or account settings. We may send transactional messages related to your account and orders without consent as necessary to perform the contract.<br>
<br>12.2 We may allow creators and third parties to advertise on the Service; those third partiesâ€™ ads are subject to their own terms and privacy practices.<br><br>

<header><h2>13. Intellectual Property</h2></header>

<header><h2>14. Security & Data Breach Notification</h2></header>

<header><h2>15. Analytics & Aggregated Data</h2></header>
15.1 We may analyze user activity and create aggregated, anonymized datasets for product improvement, research and marketing. Aggregated/anonymized data may be used for advertising, business analytics, benchmarking and to enhance the Service without identifying individuals.<br><br>

16.1 THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE." GOODPLATES DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.<br>

17.1 TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, GOODPLATES (AND ITS AFFILIATES, EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, LICENSORS AND PARTNERS) WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, DATA LOSS, OR LOSS OF BUSINESS, ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE.<br>
<br>17.2 WHERE APPLICABLE LAW DOES NOT ALLOW LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, OUR LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED. If you have paid for a Service, our aggregate liability for direct damages will not exceed the amount you paid to GoodPlates in the 6 months prior to the claim (or â‚¬100 if you have not paid us).<br><br>

<header><h2>18. Indemnification</h2></header>
18.1 You agree to indemnify and hold GoodPlates and its affiliates harmless against claims, liabilities, losses and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from your breach of these Terms, your User Content, or your use of the Service.<br><br>

<header><h2>19. Termination & Account Deletion</h2></header>
19.1 We may suspend or terminate your access for breach, suspected fraud, inactivity, or other reasons. On termination you must stop using the Service. Certain obligations survive termination (including Sections 5, 11, 13, 16, 17, 18 and 22).<br>
<br>19.2 You can request account deletion via account settings or by contacting support. Deletion does not necessarily remove copies stored in backups or as required by law.<br><br>

<header><h2>20. Changes to the Service & These Terms</h2></header>
20.1 We may modify the Service or these Terms. If we materially change these Terms we will provide notice (in-app, by email, or other reasonable means). Continued use after notification constitutes acceptance of changes. Review Terms periodically.<br><br>

<header><h2>21. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h2></header>
21.1 These Terms are governed by the laws of the Netherlands, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules (chosen because GoodPlates is headquartered in Amsterdam).<br>

<header><h2>24. Miscellaneous</h2></header>
24.1 Entire agreement: These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, Refund Policy and any other documents referenced, constitute the full agreement.<br>
<br>24.2 No waiver: Failure to exercise a right is not a waiver.<br>
<br>24.3 Assignment: You may not assign these Terms without our consent; GoodPlates may assign without restriction.<br>

<header><h2>26. Recommended Legal Review</h2></header>
This document is a detailed template tailored to the Service features you described, but it is not legal advice. We strongly recommend you have these Terms reviewed and customized by qualified counsel to ensure compliance with applicable laws in all jurisdictions where you operate (consumer protection, e-commerce, tax, data protection/GDPR, advertising laws, and local age/children rules). In particular, if GoodPlates will run targeted advertising, permissible lawful bases, consent capture flows, marketing disclosures and contractual language with ad/analytics partners should be reviewed by a data-protection attorney.<br></div>
